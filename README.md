# 📘 SAP ABAP – Developer Journey Manual

## 📖 Project Description
This repository contains my personal study and practice manual on **SAP ABAP**, developed during my internship and training projects.  
The goal is to collect **commented code, exercises, notes, and explanations** to support both my learning path and anyone who wants to start developing in the SAP environment.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Document my growth path as an **SAP ABAP Developer**.  
- Create a **practical manual** with real code examples and exercises.  
- Showcase the skills acquired in real projects (reporting, ALV Grid, function modules, module pool, Smart Forms, etc.).  
- Provide an organized collection of **snippets and solved exercises**, useful for other students or junior developers.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **SAP ABAP** (SE80, SE38, SE11, SE93…)  
- **Open SQL** (SELECT, JOIN, FOR ALL ENTRIES, BINARY SEARCH)  
- **ALV Grid** with `REUSE_ALV_GRID_DISPLAY`  
- **Function Modules & Modularization** (INCLUDE TOP/SEL/FORM, subroutines, FMs, Smart Forms)  
- **SAP Database Tables** (VBAK, VBAP, KNA1, LIPS, MAKT, AUFK, AFKO, AFVC, RESB, etc.)  

## 🚀 How to Use the Manual
1. Explore the folders to find **ABAP code organized by topic**.  
2. Each exercise includes a `.abap` (or `.txt`) file with detailed comments.  
3. Documentation files also provide **logical diagrams, line-by-line explanations, and common errors**.  
4. Some projects include **step-by-step instructions** to replicate them in an SAP system.
